# Super AI System Prompt

[View Chinese Version](./README_CN.md)

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and define a set of super system prompts for AI
thinking. Its core goal is to guide AI to exhibit a structured thinking process,
deeper thinking, more precise demand insight, more flexible methodological
application, and more efficient and empathetic communication capabilities when
handling any user request.

- It does not define what specific tasks AI should "do", but rather defines "how
  to think better" when AI faces user requests.
- Therefore, you need to expand and adjust based on this foundation for your
  specific tasks.
- For example:
  - In Trae, use this prompt as `user_rules.md`
  - Then write `project_rules.md` for personal scenarios
  - The same applies in Cursor (global prompts and local prompts)
